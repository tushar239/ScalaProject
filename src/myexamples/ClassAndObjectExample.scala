// This is a "Companion Object".
// Companion Object has same name as class
// These kind of objects can be used as a factory to create instances of the class. It can have factory methods 'apply'.
// A class and its companion object can access each otherâ€™s private members. So, it means that class members become static for all companion objects.

// Why companion object is important in Scala?
// Unlike to Java, Scala has a limitation on constructors. Auxiliary constructor has to somehow called Primary constructor. This basically stops you from calling any methods as a first sentence in any constructor. This is a big limitation.
// Just like Java, a call to another constructor from a constructor has to be the first statement.
// To overcome this limitation of constructor in scala, you need use Companion Object having many apply methods as needed. Each apply method can create an instance of a class. You can call any other method of a class or companion object from apply method and based on that instantiate a class.

// In scala, object is a singleton object that can extend a class. Class cannot extend an object.
// Singleton object is a replacement of 'static' keyword of Java.
// Scala thought of that defining members as static creates concurrency problems in the multi-threaded and distributed environments.
// All members of Singleton Object are static.
// Singleton Object cannot have class parameters(constructor)
// Singleton Object can extend a class. Other way round is not true.
object SingletonRectangle extends Rectangle(1, 5) {

  // all members of Singleton Object are static

  // main method can be defined in object (not in a class) because main method is by default static and scala doesn't support static keyword.

    // Apply method example

      // apply methods are very helpful as factory methods in "Companion Singleton Objects".

      println(areaCalculator(rect4))

      // testing Rectangle's apply method
      // List, Set, Map are exactly using the same approach
      // List is a variable referring to singleton object immutable.List, which extends SeqFactory[List]
      // so when you do List(...), it invokes immutatble.List's apply method.
      //      override def apply[A](xs: A*): List[A] = xs.toList
      // This apply method simply converts passed array to a list.
